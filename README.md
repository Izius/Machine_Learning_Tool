# Machine learning tool

## About the tool

In this project I am creating GUI for using machine learning algorithms in Python. Tkinter library is used for creating user interface, pandas for importing csv data and processing it, numpy for some basic computation and scikit-learn for machine learning methods. In the csv_files directory are some of the datasets that you can use for performing the algorithms.

## Requierements

Tkinter is part of the standard Python library. How to install pandas, numpy and scikit-klearn in terminal using pip is shown down bellow. 
```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
```

## What is coming next

I will constantly update the code and add new algorithms. First part will consist of changing the look of the GUI and positioning and naming of widgets. When I am done with this part I will add screenshots section in readme.md and provide viewers with step by step on how to use my application. In the second part I will constantly add new algorithms for example KNN, support vector machines, polynomial regression, decission trees and so on.
