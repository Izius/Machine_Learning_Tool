# Machine learning tool

## About the tool

In this project I am creating GUI for using machine learning algorithms in Python. Tkinter library is used for creating user interface, pandas for importing csv data and processing it, numpy for some basic computation and scikit-learn for machine learning methods. In the csv_files directory are some of the datasets that you can use for performing the algorithms.

## Requierements

Tkinter is part of the standard Python library. How to install pandas, numpy and scikit-klearn in terminal using pip is shown down bellow. 
```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
```
