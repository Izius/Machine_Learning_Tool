In this project I am creating GUI for using machine learning algorithms. Tkinter library is used for creating user interface, pandas for importing csv data and processing it and sklearn for machine learning methods. In the csv_files directory are two datasets, 'Advertising.csv' is meant to be for linear regression and 'iris.csv' is meant for logistic regression. Those two are only algorithms for now but I will constantly add more of them.
